      <h1 id="purpose-of-this-project">Purpose of This Project</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to design a syllable-based input system for the Manju Hergen. The Manju Hergen syllables are traditionally called “uju”, and is organized into 12 groups: a, ai, ar, an, ang, ak, as/aš, at, ao/au, al, am. These twelve syllable groups are usually how a traditional Manchu dictionary is organized.</p>
<p>Due to certain errors in the usual rendering of the Unicode standard, for example in OS X built-in font Noto Sans Mongolian, a pre-processed table of Manchu syllables with correctly inflected characters would solve some problems in character transformation.</p>
<p>I will use the Twelve Uju table made by Wanggiyan Sure available at <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/128547926">https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/128547926</a>.</p>
<h1 id="summary-of-problems">Summary of Problems</h1>
<p>The most intricate problem of the Unicode system and Unicode Manchu fonts is in the letters “t/d” and “k”. The Noto Sans Mongolian rendering and the Unicode standard itself have created a huge problem for processing. The initial , medial and ending forms of these two letters do not correspond in the Unicode standard.</p>
<h2 id="problem-of-the-unicode-standard">Problem of the Unicode Standard</h2>
<p>The biggest problem of the Unicode standard lies in the processing of “t/d” and “k”. The initial form and medial form of “t/d” are essentially two different characters, and will be represented by “*t/ *d” and “t/d”, respectively. Similarly, the medial and final form of “k” are two different characters, and will be denoted by “k” and “k*”, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="medial-and-final-form-of-k">Medial and Final form of “k”</h3>
<ul>
<li>Medial form of “k”
<ul>
<li>Masculine form as in most of the “ak, ok, uk, ik” and “tek” is U+1874 U+180B</li>
<li>Feminine form as in most of the “ek, vk” and “kuk, guk, huk, k’ak, g’ak, h’ak” is U+1874 U+180C</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Final form of “k*”
<ul>
<li>Masculine form as in most of the “ak, ok, uk, ik” and “tek” is U+1874</li>
<li>Feminine form as in most of the “ek, vk” and “kuk, guk, huk, k’ak, g’ak, h’ak” is U+1874 U+180B</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="initial-and-medial-form-of-td">Initial and Medial form of “t/d”</h3>
<ul>
<li>Non-initial “t”
<ul>
<li>Non-initial masculine “ta, ti, to, tv” takes U+1832</li>
<li>Non-initial feminine “te, tu” takes U+1868, with “e” + U+180B, “u”+ U+180B to remove the dot for feminine vowels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-initial “d”
<ul>
<li>Non-initial masculine “da, de, do” takes U+1869 U+180B</li>
<li>Non-initial “dv” takes U+1868</li>
<li>Non-initial feminine “de, du” takes U+1869, with “e” + U+180B, “u”+ U+180B to remove the dot for feminine vowels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Initial “*t”
<ul>
<li>Initial masculine “*ta, *ti, *to, *tv” takes U+1868 U+180B (can also be U+1832)</li>
<li>Initial feminine “*te, *tu” takes U+1868, with “e” + U+180B, “u”+ U+180B to remove the dot for feminine vowels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Initial “*d”
<ul>
<li>Initial masculine “*da, *de, *do” takes U+1869</li>
<li>Initial “*dv” takes U+1868</li>
<li>Initial “*de, *du” takes U+1869 U+180B, with “e” + U+180B, “u”+ U+180B to remove the dot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="an-at-ai-uju">an, at, ai-Uju</h3>
<p>For convenience, “an, at, ai”-uju are treated separately in their non-final and final forms. The final forms are represented by “an*, at*, ai*” in our input system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The letter “i” as a syllable ending is U+1873 U+180C except in “iui, iung, iong” (affixed by U+180D in these cases).</li>
<li>A final syllable ending “i*” takes U+1873.</li>
<li>An “n” medial is ALWAYS the U+1828 U+180B.</li>
<li>Final “n*” final usually takes U+1828, but should be allowed U+1828 U+180C as another choice like in the Chinese syllable “han” (to distinguish it from the Manchu word for “king, khan”). The same should also be allowed in “en*” which should display a dot on the left to distinguish it from “a”.</li>
<li>A “t” in the middle is ALWAYS U+1832 U+180C</li>
<li>Final “t*” is simply U+1868.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-special-cases">Other Special Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>“k’v, h’v” has the same shape with “kv, hv”, but choose to not process it here.</li>
<li>“fa, fe” uses the “f” initial, “wa, we” uses the “w” initial, and “fi, fo, fu, fv” uses the “f” initial with U+180B of a similar shape as “w”.</li>
<li>“iui, iung, iong” to transcribe Chinese do not have dots and do not show any repeating “i”'s.</li>
<li>The “au/ao”-uju is a problem: in such a uju, the ending “o” is actually an “u” when pronunced, but do not display a dot on the right. However, for the purpose of completeness, we will require the user to type all “-u” endings as “-o”, and will leave the choice of typing the “-u” ending with a dot to the user.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-input-standard">The Input Standard</h1>
<h2 id="syllable-initials">Syllable Initials</h2>
<p>The native syllable initials include the following letters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>None, n, k/g/h, p/b, s/x, t/d, *t/*d (word-initial), l/m, c/j/y/r, f/w</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They should be typed as-is in the input system.</p>
<p>The Chinese initials</p>
<blockquote>
<p>k’/g’/h’, dz/ts’, ž</p>
</blockquote>
<p>should be typed as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>K/G/H, Z/C, R</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in our input system.</p>
<h2 id="vowels-and-endings-uju">Vowels and Endings (Uju)</h2>
<p>The six vowels are typed as “a, e, i, o, u, v” as in most transcription system.<br>
The endings include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-(none), i, i*(final), r, n, n*(final), ng, k, k*(final), s, x, t, t*(final), b, u, o, l, m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“None” means the syllable is open, and the vowel should be followed with a dash “-”/</p>
<p>Other special characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genitive “i” : iii</li>
<li>k’,g’,h’: K, G, H</li>
